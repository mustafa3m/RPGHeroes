RPGHeroes
Project Description
RPGHeroes is a .NET console-based role-playing game (RPG) featuring four hero classes: Mage, Ranger, Rogue, and Warrior. Each class has unique attributes, equipment compatibility, and leveling systems. The game emphasizes hero progression through leveling up, equipping weapons and armor, and calculating damage based on class-specific formulas.

This project also includes unit tests for core functionality, written using xUnit, and is version-controlled with Git. 

Features
1. Hero Classes
Mage: Specializes in magic, using staves and robes.
Ranger: Uses bows and light armor for ranged attacks.
Rogue: Focuses on stealth, using daggers and leather armor.
Warrior: Wields heavy weapons and armor for physical combat.
2. Hero Attributes
Each hero class has unique attributes:

Strength
Dexterity
Intelligence
These attributes increase as the hero levels up, with bonuses varying by class.

3. Leveling System
Heroes start at level 1 and gain experience through actions.
Leveling up increases hero attributes and overall power.

5. Equipment System
Heroes can equip weapons and armor suited to their class.
Valid equipment includes:
Weapons: Staves, bows, daggers, swords, etc.
Armor: Cloth, leather, and plate.
Equipping invalid items throws custom exceptions (InvalidWeaponException, InvalidArmorException).


6. Damage Calculation
Damage is based on the heroâ€™s attributes and equipped weapon.
Each class has its own damage formula (e.g., Warriors rely on Strength, Mages rely on Intelligence).
Project Structure
Heroes: Class definitions for Mage, Ranger, Rogue, and Warrior.
Attributes: Manages the Strength, Dexterity, and Intelligence attributes.
Equipment: Handles weapon and armor systems for each hero.
Exceptions: Custom exceptions (InvalidWeaponException, InvalidArmorException).
Tests: Unit tests using xUnit to verify functionality.
